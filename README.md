# MP-Sim
This is a simulator for running motion profiles on robots. Right now, it only supports tank drive motion profiles
in the same format as those created by Jaci's Pathfinder.

## Dependencies
Required Python libraries are Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This software was developed under Python 3.6.1,
Numpy 1.14.2, Scipy 1.0.1, Pandas 0.22.0, and Matplotlib 2.2.2.

## How to Use
Download all files and run main.py. For now, constants can only be changed by editing the files.
